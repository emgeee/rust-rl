# Rust RL

This project contains code for using RL to finetune models to write better rust code. It is based off the blog post by oxen https://www.oxen.ai/blog/training-a-rust-1-5b-coder-lm-with-reinforcement-learning-grpo.
Results from the eval can be found at the oxen repo https://www.oxen.ai/mgreen/qwen3-rust-finetune.

This project was done as a learning exercise to explore RL and evals. Much of the code was generated automatically using claude code and is of dubious quality that barely works.
